# Mobile-Robot-Navigation-Using-Fuzzy-Logic
A project to design and simulate a robot control system using fuzzy logic in CoppeliaSim. The robot navigates to a goal while avoiding obstacles, leveraging sensor data to make decisions. Includes fuzzification, a rule base, and defuzzification for adaptive navigation in dynamic environments. Ideal for robotics research.
